/**
 * The main template file.
 *
 * When the site is loaded, WordPress calls this file to serve the theme. Since
 * our theme is decoupled, we really only use this to bootstrap the API setup
 * and provide a framework for our client-side MVC to draw from.
 *
 * "Wait! Why is there HTML and code ususally found in separate files?"
 * Great question! Since we're not relying on WordPress to parse and output
 * finished pages, we don't need all of the typical files used to render single
 * posts, archives, pages, author information, etc. which means we can improve
 * performance by keeping what little markup we do need all in one place. Neat!
